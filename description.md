####<i>Just general notes to describe the functionality I want to have in my program

<i>
Making dinner easy by enabling the user to find and collect recipes that they can later select to 'cook' at which point the order will be placed with a local supermarket with online ordering capability, it will only order from Coles to begin with!

NOTE: You still need to do the actual cooking
</i>

###Functionality

- Scrape a variety of recipe websites for specific recipes and add them to the database
- Display the recipes in a GUI including the cooking time, ingredients and an image of the meal
- Allow the addition of recipes
- - Custom recipes
- - Recipes directly from a URL
- Enable selection of a few meals and a combined list of ingredients that will be needed to make all recipes
- Enable the ordering of all ingredients to be delivered ASAP or on a requested date that is far enough in the future to make it possible
- Maybe in the future it will also be able to keep a track of the food that is ordered and the meals that were actually 'cooked' so that it can know if something does not need to be ordered. For instance if 1kg of flour is bought one week and the recipe only required 0.5kg, we would still have 0.5kg of flour on hand, and so no more would need to be ordered. This would require physical input from someone to say when a meal had actually been cooked
- Have drill down menu's for filtering the visible recipes by protein or by type i.e. vegetarian
- Have a way to randomly select a 'menu' for the week that will provide a given number of recipes for the week (If you can't decide what you want)
